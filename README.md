# Car Sales Analysis and Regression
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze car sales data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, train-test splitting, and building a linear regression model to predict car sales based on given features. The results are interpreted to provide business insights and strategic recommendations.

## Project Structure
    1. Data
       ● Input Files:
         ● car_sales.csv: The dataset for visualization and EDA.
         ● processed_car_sales.csv: The preprocessed dataset.
         ● normalized_car_sales.csv: The normalized preprocessed dataset.
       ● Output Files:
         ● X_train.csv, X_test.csv, y_train.csv, y_test.csv: Train-test split results.
         ● regression_predictions.csv: Predictions based on the linear regression model.
    2. Code
       ● visualisasi_EDA.py: Script for data exploration and visualization.
       ● train_test_regression.py: Script for preprocessing, train-test splitting, model training, and evaluation.
